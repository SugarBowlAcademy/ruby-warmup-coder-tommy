petnames = ["ghost", "enzo", "spice", "spike", "fido"]
petnames.each do [names]
  puts names
end

petnames = ["ghost", "enzo", "spice", "spike", "fido"]
for [names] in petnames
  puts names
end



=begin
I prefer the for [names] in petnames version of the loop because it is what I would think to do
=end
